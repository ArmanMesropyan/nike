    With debossed lotus graphics and vibrant bursts of Lotus Pink throughout, the design's motif nods to a flower known to flourish in even the harshest conditions. Gold embroidery and a sky-blue outsole symbolize hope for the future, just as the immigrants who arrived during the California Gold Rush persevered for the promise of tomorrow. The tongue and insole are also adorned with lotus flowers, along with characters spelling 舊金山 (Gau Gam Saan, or "Old Gold Mountain")—a symbolic reminder of the grit that can overcome adversity.
    Nike is proud to invest in nonprofits working to advance equality in communities where everyone can thrive. One of our partners is The Asian American Foundation (TAAF) whose mission is to serve the AAPI community in their pursuit of belonging and prosperity.`,

    Get away and immerse yourself. The Air Max 1 "Escape" takes you back through Nike's long record of trail running and pushing boundaries. 
    
    Debuting in 1984, with Mount St. Helens still smoldering on the horizon, the Nike Escape broke away from the ordinary. The design paved the way for, well, getting the hell out of dodge—and it was soon beloved and coveted by trail runners everywhere.
    
    Celebrating that history, the AM1 "Escape" pairs classic running DNA with Pacific Northwest-inspired details. The striking colors were pulled from an iconic Nike running ad—one that featured Mount St. Helens' caldera billowing in the background. An embroidered forest scene at the heel is worthy of wanderlust. And the rugged suede accents, airy textile, and boot-inspired laces finish your look. Time to escape.`,
